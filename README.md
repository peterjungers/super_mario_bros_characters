# Super Mario Bros. character database
This program allows users to construct a database of characters from Nintendo's Mario games, including a character's name, the game in which they first appeared, and the date the game was released. Part of the intent of the program was to allow users to try to create the database from their own knowledge of the characters and games. It was made in June and July of 2022.

Included in these files is the small CSV database I used to test the programâ€”I can't vouch for all the information being correct :)
